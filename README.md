# 🌸 Ethereal Blossoms — Project Introduction
Link: https://shuyi-huang.github.io/Flower-website/Home.html

Ethereal Blossoms is a modern, elegant flower e-commerce website that I designed and developed to showcase my front-end development skills and UI/UX design capabilities. The site delivers a clean and visually appealing user experience, providing customers with an intuitive way to browse floral collections, explore product details, and learn about the brand’s story.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project demonstrates my ability to build responsive, mobile-friendly web pages and implement interactive elements that enhance user engagement. The aesthetic design focuses on soft visuals, balanced layouts, and a brand identity that reflects beauty, calmness, and natural elegance—aligning with the theme of a boutique flower shop.
